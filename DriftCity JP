Hii miyuyami
It is possible to make Drift City JP an english Patch 
http://driftcity.arario.jp/

there was an english version but got closed down 2 yers ago and ever since then the community is playing in jp so hard to get around
would it be possible if you can make slight ajustments to get around buying parts with the right specs writing on them

Thank you for your time
